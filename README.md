# Description
A knockoff version of PyTorch implemented with Numpy, with support for forward layers and backprop. This library would not exist without the support from the CMU class I took it from.

# Setup/Requirements
TryTorch (which is actually named mytorch) wants to tried out, so clone the repo!
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install matplotlib numpy
pip install ctcdecode # for rnns
```
